### setting the working directory

### install packages for graph illustrations and 
install.packages("dplyr") ## basic function
install.packages("igraph") ## graph illustration
install.packages("ggplot2") ## for elegant and complex plot graphs
install.packages("ggthemes") ## add-on to ggplot2

## loading packages
library(dplyr)
library(igraph)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)

## loading the data
df <- read.csv("DIPCON_3.0_Dyads.csv") # data and documentation from: http://www.u.arizona.edu/~volgy/data.html

## inspecting the data
df

### using dplyr to keep only relations for 2000
df2000 <- df %>% # selecting th data set
  filter(dipcon2000 > 0) %>% # keeping only the connections in 2000
  select(abbrev1, abbrev2) # selecting the variables

### Now we want to see ONLY the USA, to see what country relations they had from 2000-2010
#In order to not delete/ edit in our original dataset, we need to create a new dataframe.
df1 <- c("abbrev1","abbrev2","dipcon2000","dipcon2005","dipcon2010")
View(df1)
# Here we told the new dataframe to only have abbrev1, abbrev2, and the 3 years as columns. 
## Next I want to tell R how many rows of the data I want to use. 
df1 <- df[c(2:195), c(2,4,11,12,13)]
View(df1)

### Then it has to be illustrated in a graph object



### using dplyr to keep only relations for 2005
df2005 <- df %>% # selecting th data set
  filter(dipcon2005 > 0) %>% # keeping only the connections in 2005
  select(abbrev1, abbrev2) # selecting the variables
  
### using dplyr to keep only relations for 2010
df2010 <- df %>% # selecting th data set
  filter(dipcon2010 > 0) %>% # keeping only the connections in 2010
  select(abbrev1, abbrev2) # selecting the variables
  
#Turning into a graph object
g2000 <- graph.data.frame(df2000, directed = F) # storing the graph as "undirected" for the sake of simplicity
g2005 <- graph.data.frame(df2005, directed = F) # storing the graph as "undirected" for the sake of simplicity
g2010 <- graph.data.frame(df2010, directed = F) # storing the graph as "undirected" for the sake of simplicity

### how many diplomatic ties does a country have on average in 2010
mean(degree(g2000))
mean(degree(g2005))
mean(degree(g2010))


### What is the density?
graph.density(g2000)
graph.density(g2005)
graph.density(g2010)

### exporting to gephi
write.graph(g2000, "dipcon2000.graphml", format = "graphml")
